## Things to know:
Given that this sample was build for front-end purposes this will not include a back-end connection. Instead, we are grabbing some fake values from some JSON files. The only flights available are EPA-COR and EPA-MDZ.

## Requirements
Given that this project is based on 'create-next-app' the requirements are the same ones.

- Node >= 10.13

## How to set up the project
The basic steps to set up the project are:
- Clone the repo
- Open the folder
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm start```

This project also has ESlint configured so, you have two more scripts that you can use:
- ```npm run lint```
- ```npm run lint:fix```

If you need more specific steps, follow the next ones.

First, clone the repository or download it as a zip. To clone use this command:

```
  git clone https://github.com/powerOFMAX/flight-finder.git
```

Go to the main folder using  ```cd flight-finder/```

Open the terminal on that folder and run
```
  npm install
```
Once its done, run ```npm run dev``` and you should be able to see the project up and running on ```http://localhost:3000/```
